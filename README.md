# 🏎️ Formula 1 – Historical Driver Analysis

This project was developed as a final assignment for the **Data Analysis** course at UTN – FRC. The goal was to apply tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI on a real dataset to extract valuable insights through data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and effective storytelling.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Google Colab):**
  - Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
  - sqlite3 (embedded SQL)
- **Power BI**
- **Canva** (for presentation design)
- **GitHub / Notion** (portfolio management)

## 📊 Key Analyses

- Null value handling (e.g., missing championships)
- Duplicate and inconsistency checks
- Statistical outlier detection
- Correlation analysis between key performance metrics
- Career duration trends by decade
- Visual exploration through custom charts and SQL filters

## 🧠 Insights

- **Formula 1 is extremely exclusive**: most drivers never win a race or a title.
- **Lewis Hamilton** stands out across almost every metric (🐐).
- Pole positions, wins, and podiums show strong correlation.
- The average F1 driver’s career is short (1–2 years) and becoming increasingly selective.
