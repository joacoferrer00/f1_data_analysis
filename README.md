# üèéÔ∏è Formula 1 ‚Äì Historical Driver Analysis

This project was developed as a final assignment for the **Data Analysis** course at UTN ‚Äì FRC. The goal was to apply tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI on a real dataset to extract valuable insights through data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and effective storytelling.

  - `clean_data.csv`: Cleaned and processed dataset used in Power BI.

- **`notebooks/`**
  - `f1_analysis.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook including SQL queries, data processing, EDA, and visualizations.

- **`powerbi/`**
  - `f1_dashboard.pbix`: Interactive dashboard built in Power BI with filters and key visualizations.

- **`presentation/`**
  - `resumen_f1_analysis.pdf`: Final presentation with structure, key insights, and conclusions.

## üîç Dataset Overview

Historical dataset of Formula 1 drivers, including:
- Nationality
- Active years
- Championships won
- Race wins, podiums, and total points
- Derived metrics: win rate and points per race

Source: Kaggle

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Google Colab):**
  - Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
  - sqlite3 (embedded SQL)
- **Power BI**
- **Canva** (for presentation design)
- **GitHub / Notion** (portfolio management)

## üìä Key Analyses

- Null value handling (e.g., missing championships)
- Duplicate and inconsistency checks
- Statistical outlier detection
- Correlation analysis between key performance metrics
- Career duration trends by decade
- Visual exploration through custom charts and SQL filters

## üß† Insights

- **Formula 1 is extremely exclusive**: most drivers never win a race or a title.
- **Lewis Hamilton** stands out across almost every metric (üêê).
- Pole positions, wins, and podiums show strong correlation.
- The average F1 driver‚Äôs career is short (1‚Äì2 years) and becoming increasingly selective.
